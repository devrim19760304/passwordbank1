# Lesson 28-11-2024
Today we have created and admin password and user interface by using 
 - html 
 - Javascript 
 - Bootstrap
 - Our own css for fine tuning

 ## The Aim 
 our aim was to combine different elements such as if statement, and conditions
 and create a beautiful interface.
 We have also learnt how we could create a static table thead and tbody

 ## How program works
 The user should provide correct admin name and password combination to redirect 
 admin page otherwise page will give alert such wrong combination 

 ## Bootstrap 
 we have borrowed bootstrap form , input and button and label and table


 ## What next?
 In admin page our aim is to enter users and create a dynamic table from these dataset.
 According to our program logic, the app must calculate nettoincome by using age and zone 
 tax rate percentates. Please refer document i have shared to calculate tax rates.
